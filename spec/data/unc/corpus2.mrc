Access through code (e.g., R or Python) or specialized programs (e.g., Voyant) is recommended.  aUnited States.  aCOCA includes 560 million words over the period 1990 to the present, scanned from novels, magazines, newspapers, and academic works, and from transcripts of the spoken word. Created by Mark Davies, Professor of Linguistics at Brigham Young University. The corpus has many different uses, including: finding out how native speakers actually speak and write; finding the frequency of words, phrases, and collocates; looking at language variation and change, e.g., historical, dialects, and genres; gaining insight into culture, e.g., what is said about different concepts over time and in different countries; designing authentic language teaching materials and resources.  aFile organization: Users may choose material by genre but not by year. Lexicon, source, and sub-genre code files are also included.  aData may not be distributed outside the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Data are intended for use in research, not teaching; use the standard web interface for the corpus.5NuC. 0aCorpora (Linguistics)vDatabases. 0aEnglish languagezUnited StatesvDatabases. 7aDatabases.2lcgft. 0aCorpora (Linguistics).1 aDavies, Mark,d1963 April 22-ecompiler.40uhttp://spruce.lib.unc.edu.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/content/dataservices/COCA/yUNC-Chapel Hill Authentication Required  a.b93086015b08-09-18c08-08-18  aerb08-08-18cmd~e-fenggutuh0i1 1g1lerrsntadt11h0u-  aC0bNOC  g1j0lerrs ntadonp$0.00q-r-s-  t11u0v0w0x0y.i117860396z08-08-18
